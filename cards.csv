She has no cranial nerve deficits, and she has normal mental status. Her exam is otherwise reassuring. Diffusion weighted imaging shows no areas of restricted diffusion. Her MRI imaging reveals a ride sided area of gadolidium enhancement on T1 weighted images. This same area is hyperintense on T2 weighted images.

Lyme encephalitisD. Multiple Sclerosis","D. Multiple sclerosis.

What is the first line therapy for this patient?","Steroids are indicated for the acute attack.For disease modification, a discussion should be had with the patient and family about rituximab (more effective) vs. older therapies such as glatiramer acetate or interferon beta-1a (fewer side effects).",Neurology
You are caring for a 12 year old patient who presents with diminished visual acuity in her left eye developing over 2 days. She now feels that her vision in her right eye is also becoming worse. T1 post gadolinium weighted images of the optic nerves are shown. Here aquaporin-4 IgG is positive. What is the diagnosis and first line treatment?,"The presence of bilateral demyelination (as evidenced by her symptoms and bilateral optic nerve enhancement on MRI imaging) combined with positive aquaporin-4 antibody are diagnostic for neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorders. Since she is aquaporin-4 antibody positive, no further clinical criteria are required. However, accompanying transvere myelitis and/or area postrema syndrome (intractable hiccups and/or vomiting) would further support the diagnosis. First line treatment for attacks is steroids. Immunomodulator therapy may be employed for disease modification, but specific drug choices vary widely between providers and institutions. Image credit: Sechi E, et al.

What is the most common source of the toxin responsible for infantile botulism?A. Colonization by spores from dust or soil in the environment which then synthesize and release toxin.B. Preformed toxin from improperly canned vegetables. C. Colonization by spores from honey which then synthesize and release toxin.D. Preformed toxin present in soil or dust in the environment.,"A. Colonization by spores from dust or soil in the environment which then synthesize and release toxin.Although botulism spores have been found in honey, widespread discouragement of administration of honey to infants has failed to decrease the incidence of infantile botulism, which has only increased over time. Only 20% of cases occur in children with known honey exposure, and environmental (dust, dirt) exposure is considered the most frequent source.Infantile botulism is due to colonization of the intestinal tract by spores. After the first year of life, the gut microbiome suppresses growth of botulism spores. In contrast, foodborne botulism is due to preformed toxins coming from misprepared canned foods.",Neurology
